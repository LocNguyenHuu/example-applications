# Example Streaming Application: (Flink Streaming API) Wordcount from Socket DataSource

## Overview

The example streaming application shows an example of an application that can be deployed using the PNDA Deployment Manager. (See the `platform-deployment-manager` project for details.)

This example uses the Flink Streaming APIs.

The application is a tar file containing binaries and configuration files required to perform some stream processing.

This example application reads events from a network socket and performs basic counting analytics. To run the data source run the command `nc -l 9100` on the pnda data node and then type some input into it.

The results are printed into the console output of the flink driver process. To view these: 
Go to the specific container direcotory under /var/log/pnda/hadoop-yarn/container on respective data node.
For Running applications, you can also view them through the Yarn Resource Manager UI(RUNNING -> <application ID> -> ApplicationMaster -> Task Managers -> <Task Manager> -> stdout).

## Requirements

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.0.5/release-notes.html) 3.0.5
* [Java JDK](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) 1.8

## Build
Edit the `streaming-app/pom.xml` file with the appropriate version and dependencies if necessary. Specifically flink.version and scala.version should match the available flink version on PNDA cluster. For example, current pom.xml assumes Flink version as 1.4 and scala as 2.11 in the PNDA cluster.
Please refer the Flink official site to get the scala compatible version with Flink version if necessary.


To build the example applications use:

````
mvn clean package
````

This command should be run at the root of the repository and will build the application package. It will create a package file `flink-socket-streaming-example-app-{version}.tar.gz` in the `app-package/target` directory.

## Files in the package

- `application.properties`: config file used by the Flink Streaming scala application.
- `properties.json`: contains default properties that may be overriden at application creation time.

## Deploying the package and creating an application

The PNDA console can be used to deploy the application package to a cluster and then to create an application instance. The console is available on port 80 on the edge node.

To make the package available for deployment it must be uploaded to a package repository. The default implementation is an OpenStack Swift container. The package may be uploaded via the PNDA repository manager which abstracts the container used, or by manually uploading the package to the container.

Make sure to set `input_data_host` to the host that is running the `nc -l 9100` command that is used to provide data to the application.

Once the application is running, type some text into the nc input and view the results in the flink's taskmanager.out on driver host. To view this file navigate to the taskmanager log via the Yarn Resource Manager UI or use the PNDA log server.

## Accessing Apache Flink Dashboard

- `Running Jobs` : To view Flink Dashboard for running application, navigate to yarn UI, go to running flink job and click on it's Tracking UI for application master. It allows to access log files for running YARN applications and shows diagnostics for failed apps.

- `Completed Jobs`: To query the status and statistics of completed jobs that have been archived by a JobManager navigate to the HistoryServer UI by clicking cog button of Flink component in PNDA Console.
